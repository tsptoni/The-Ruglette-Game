Take care that this is a Gambling Token, which means that in any point you could lost all your investment, but of course you could make huge profits if you play well and have luck.

## <span style="color:blue">Game rules:</span>


- Token will be live between 2 to 5 days. After this time, a **winner** will be picked randomly and the rug will happen.
- When the token is launched, there is a **grace period called the Shitcoin Lounge**. This grace period ends when there are **minimum 20 holders**. At this moment, the wild west war starts!
- For each new **buy** transaction, a bullet will be shoot from your address. A few thins can happen:
    - **You hit another wallet (70% probability)** and theft his tokens in an amount equal of 1% of your holdings. If your victim wallet holdings is lower than your hit power, then you kill him, but you will rewarded only the available holding of that wallet.
        - If the victim wallet is your wallet, then you will hit yourself, damaging you by 0.5% of your total holdings.
    - **You miss the shot (20% probability)** so nothing happens.
    - **Your gun explodes (10% probability)**, if this occurs, you will lose 2% of your total holdings.
- When the game ends (this will happen in any time between 2 to 5 days), **nobody can buy or sell tokens**.
    - A winner will be picked randomly and will be the unique able to sell his tokens in order to retrieve his prize.
    - **The prize will be equal to 30% of the net balance** ((buys - sells). Initial liquidity is not included in this prize.
    - The winner will have a maximum of 1 day to claim his prize (this is done selling his tokens in PancakeSwap)
- One day after the game ends, the **Rug Pull will happen**, so no liquidity will be keep.


## Tricks:

- If you perform multiple **buy** transactions, then you will shoot several times, but be careful as you can also loose some tokens.
